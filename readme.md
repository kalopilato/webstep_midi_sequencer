# WebStep

WebStep is a browser based, grid style MIDI step sequencer.  It doesn't currently have any built in audio engine so you'll need at least one MIDI hardware output device connected to do anything useful.  That being said, WebStep should work fine with _any_ MIDI enabled synthesizer/sampler that's visible to your operating system.

This project is a work in progress and is really just a learning exercise as I fumble my way through learning about a few things I'm interested in:
* React
* Redux
* JS / ES6
* Webpack
* Babel
* Web MIDI API

This is definitely not an example of React/Redux best practise or how to structure a JS app but, as I learn more and time allows, the code quality _should_ improve. :persevere:

WebStep is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://kalopilato.github.io/webstep_midi_sequencer/) if you'd like to give it a go.

***Note:** The Web MIDI API has limited browser support. This app is developed using the latest version of Chrome and hasn't been tested for compatibility in any other browsers.*
